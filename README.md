# ☀️ SunWise: Unlock Your Rooftop's Solar Potential  
**🏆 Built in 24 Hours at Scarlet_Hawks_2025 | Theme: Environmental Sustainability**

---

## 🌍 Overview

**SunWise** is an intelligent web application designed to empower individuals and communities to explore the solar energy potential of their rooftops. Built in just 24 hours during the **Scarlet_Hawks_2025 Hackathon**, this project combines the power of **Machine Learning**, **Google Maps**, and **climate data** to offer **personalized solar predictions** based on geolocation and rooftop characteristics.

With just a location input, users can visualize their rooftops on a satellite map, receive real-time predictions of solar energy output, estimate cost savings, and understand their environmental impact — all within a sleek and interactive interface.
